Assignment
----------

* Make sure that you have a valid account that allows you access to Young 306 computer lab
* Send a letter of introduction including your background and interest in the class.  Include any topics that you are specifically interested in learning about during the course.

1. In this chapter we explored histones as an example of a protein that can be challenging to study because it is part of a large gene family. Another challenging example is ubiquitin. How many ubiquitins are there in the human genome, and what is the sequence of a prototypical (that is, representative) ubiquitin? 

2. How many human proteins are bigger than 300,000 daltons? Hints: Try to first limit your search to human by using TaxBrowser. Then follow the link to Entrez Protein, where all the results will be limited to human. Enter a command in the format xxxxxx:yyyyyy[molwt] to restrict the output to a certain number of Daltons; for example, 002000:010000[molwt] will select proteins of molecular weight 2,000 to 10,000.

3. You are interested in learning about genes involved in breast cancer. Which genes have been implicated? What are the DNA and protein accession numbers for several of these genes? Try all five of these approaches: PubMed, Entrez, LocusLink, OMIM, and SRS at ExPASy.

4. An ATP (adenosine triphosphate) binding cassette (ABC) is an example of a common protein domain that is found in many so-called ABC transporter proteins. However, you are not familiar with this motif and would like to learn more. Approximately how many human proteins have ABC domains? Approximately how many bacterial proteins have ABC domains? Which of the resources you used in problem 2.3 is most useful in providing you a clear definition of an ABC motif ? (We will discuss additional resources to solve this problem in Chapter 8.)

5. Find the accession number of a lipocalin protein (e.g., retinol-binding protein, lactoglobulin, any bacterial lipocalin, glycodelin, or odorant-binding protein). First, use Entrez, then UniGene, then OMIM. Which approach is most effective? What is the function of this protein?

6. Three prominent tools for text-based searching of molecular information are:
- the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s PubMed, Entrez, and OMIM tools (► http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov),
- the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) Sequence Retrieval System (SRS) (► http://srs.ebi.ac.uk) or its related SRS site (► http://www.expasy.ch/srs5/), and
- DBGET, the GenomeNet tool of Kyoto University, and the University of Tokyo (► http://www.genome.ad.jp/dbget/dbget2.html) literature database LitDB.

You are interested in learning more about West Nile virus. What happens when you use that query to search each of these three resources?


7. You would like to know what articles about viruses have been published in the journal BMC Bioinformatics. Do this search using PubMed.



All assignments should be emailed to abinkowski@uchicago.edu and TA by midnight of the night the assignment is due.  No late assignments will be accepted.
